# MyPlanner – Weekly Task and Event Manager

## Project Objectives
MyPlanner is a lightweight weekly planner that helps users organize their daily **events** and **tasks** in a clean, structured way.  
It allows users to add, edit, or remove events and tasks, and view their progress throughout the week.

## Key Users
- **University students** who want to manage lectures, deadlines, and personal goals.
- **Young professionals** who prefer a minimalist weekly overview instead of cluttered calendars.

## Key Use Cases
1. Add, update, and delete events (e.g., "Math Lecture – Monday 10AM").
2. Add and track tasks with completion status (e.g., "Finish EECS 2030 Lab").
3. View the full week layout with both tasks and events.
4. Get a quick status summary of completed vs. pending tasks.

## Key Scenarios
A student uses MyPlanner every Sunday night to schedule assignments and upcoming events for the week, ensuring balanced workload tracking.

## Project Goals
- Provide a **simple**, **offline**, and **accessible** planner.
- Practice modular Java design with **MVC architecture**.
- Build a scalable foundation for future features (notifications, analytics, etc.).
