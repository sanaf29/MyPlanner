	 * The Day class represents one day within the week.
	 * Each Day holds a list of events (time-specific activities)
	 * and a list of tasks (to-do items without specific times).
	 *
	 * Responsibilities:
	 * - Store, add, and remove events and tasks for the day.
	 * - Display the full schedule of events and pending tasks.
	 * - Maintain separation between timed events and general tasks.
	 *
	 * Each Day is linked to a specific name (e.g., "Monday")
	 * and acts as the central unit for daily scheduling.
